  <h6>New Jersey</h6>  
  <p>
    New Jersey is a state in the Mid-Atlantic and <b>Northeastern regions of the United States.</b> It is bordered on the north and east by the state of New York; on the east, southeast, and south by the Atlantic Ocean; on the west by the <b>Delaware River and Pennsylvania</b>; and on the southwest by Delaware Bay and the state of Delaware.
  </p>

  <p>
    I like New jersey mainly because of it's history around <b>180 million years</b> ago, during  the Jurassic Period, <b>New Jersey bordered North Africa.</b> The pressure of the collision between North America and Africa gave rise to the Appalachian Mountains. Around 18,000 years ago, the Ice Age resulted in glaciers that reached New Jersey
   And it mainly suits my life style. New jersey has vast number of beaches, pubs, movie theatres etc.
